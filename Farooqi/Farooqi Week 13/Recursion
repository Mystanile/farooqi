walk(100)

# this works by calling the function walk with the number of steps as an argument.
# it checks if the number of steps is 0, if so it returns and stops the recursion.
# if not, it calls itself with the number of steps - 1 and prints the current step.
# this continues until the base case is reached, at which point the function returns and the program ends.
#The reason it goes from 1 to 100
