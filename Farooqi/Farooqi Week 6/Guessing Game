# Program Description: This is a number-guessing game where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user must guess it. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low and keeps track of the number of attempts.

print("Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!")
print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")
    
while True:
    random_number = random.randint(1, 100)
    attempts = 10
    for attempt in range(1, attempts + 1):
        guess = int(input(f"Attempt {attempt}: "))
        if guess < random_number:
            print("Too low, guess higher")
        elif guess > random_number:
            print("Too high, guess lower.")
        else:
            print(f"Good job. The number was {random_number}. You guessed it in {attempt} attempts.")
            break
    else:
        print(f"You failed to guess the number in {attempts} attempts.")
        print(f"Actual Number was: {random_number}")
        
    continue_game = input("Do you want to continue (Y/N)? ").strip().upper()
    if continue_game != 'Y':
